  Practice coding Daily
</h2>

<p >
  I feel solving problems creatively is the most important skill that a developer should master! 
  So, I decided to improve it by coding atleast one problem everyday.
  The goal is to practice common dsa and competitive problems daily from different sources like hackerrank, kattis, codewars etc.
